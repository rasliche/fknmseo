            <h3>What is Blue Star</h3>
            <p>The Blue Star program was established to recognize tour operators who work to reduce the impact of divers and snorkelers on coral reefs of the Florida Keys. Unlike some of the major causes of reef decline such as climate change, damage to reefs from diving and snorkeling is considered preventable.</p>

            <p>As a Blue Star partner, your business has voluntarily agreed to educate customers about the coral reef ecosystem, the Sanctuary, and diving and snorkeling etiquette. By passing this information on to visitors who dive or snorkel in the Keys, you are playing an important role in helping to protect our reefs.</p>

            <h3>Why Blue Star?</h3>

            <p>Florida Keys coral reefs are a main draw for your customers. But what if those corals were damaged, sick, or just went away? What would that mean for you, your customers, and your business?</p>

            <p>The reefs of the Florida Keys are stressed. And when reef users are uninformed or irresponsible, they can, and often do, make these stresses even worse. That's bad news.</p>

            <p>The good news is that, as a Blue Star partner, you have the opportunity to teach visitors about the reef and how to safely interact with it. If the information that you provide could change even one of those visitors' behaviors to be reef-aware, think about the good you could be doing.</p>

            <p>The Blue Star program is one way that you can show customers - people who were drawn to the area because of the environment in the first place - that you and the business that you work for care about the ecosystem and are committed to doing your part to protect it.</p>

            <h3>What is Required as Part of Blue Star?</h3>

            <p>Blue Star operators have made a commitment to train their staff and customers to be better environmental stewards. As part of the program, operators are required to complete training each year on issues affecting coral reefs, Sanctuary regulations, and coral reef etiquette. In turn, these operators must educate their customers on these topics. They also must offer conservation-related dive courses and participate in activities such as fish counts and reef clean-ups.</p>

            <p>Once a business has gone through the initial evaluation and is recognized as a Blue Star partner, they will be reevaluated each year, to make sure that the Blue Star criteria are still being followed.</p>

            <p>You should have a copy of the Blue Star framework, which outlines the specifics of what each operator is required to do to be "Blue Star recognized."</p>
